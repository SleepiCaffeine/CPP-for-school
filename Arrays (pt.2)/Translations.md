#Bonus Challenge:
*Every program must be able to read, use and write text files*

##Task 1:
Create a program that would reverse an array, without using another array

##Task 2:
Given a size *n* array. Products that cost less than the average should have their price increased by *p* percent. Create a program that would return the average of the newly raised product prices

##Task 3:
Given an array of the average temperature of each month, create a program that would show how many times the temperature average was above positive, but less than *t0*

##Task 4:
Given an integer array (size is to be determined by you), create a program that would show how many times there was a double sign number that started with 3 

##Task 5:
Given an array of integers, containing the average atmospheric pressure of an entire year, create a program that would show how many days had a pressure higher than *p1*, but lower than *p2*

##Task 6:
Given an array of integers and the array size *n*, create a program that would write "YES" if the array is symmetrical, and "NO" if it is not

Example:
| in.txt | out.txt |
| ------ | ------- |
| 8 ___ 5 8 4 6 9 4 5 6 | NO |
| 10 ___  6 7 1 5 9 9 5 1 7 6 | YES |
| 9 ___  6 4 8 1 2 1 8 4 6 | YES |

##Task 7:
Given a 1-dimentional array, which has *n* numbers, create a program that would find the only 2 numbers that repeat, and would show their indecies, as well as the number that was repeated

Example:
| in.txt | out.txt | Explanation |
| ------ | ------- | ----------- |
| 20 ___ 19 7 2 6 90 1 4580 32 5 0 654 25 4 62 120 65 -4 0 87 -84| 9 17 0 | The numbers at indecies 9 and 17 are identical (0) |
