## Task 1:
Given an array of size *2n*, that has an *n* number of husband and wife heights, where the odd indecies contain the wives' heights and the even indecies contain the husbands' heights. Create a program that would compare the heigh differences in their respective groups and return the largest difference between them

## Task 2:
Given an array of *n* products (*n* < 101), create a program that would return the amount of times the product with the highest price repeats in the array. Sort the array and then return the result

## Task 3:
Given an array of the average temperature of every day in a year, and an array of the average pressure each day, create a program that would return the longest amount of days in a row, where the temperature was positive and the pressure was above *p0* 

## Task 4:
A repair workshop gets orders of nuts of threads M3 to M16. There are an *n* number of orders (*n* < 500). The data is given in a text file as such: the first line contains *n*, in the other *n* lines - there are 2 numbers, the first is an integer from 3 to 16, the second - an integer, representing the amount of nuts in the order. Create a program that would calculate, which nut thread was the most frequent and how many of each thread was given.

## Task 5:
Given an array of *n* integer coordinate points (3 < *n* < 101), create a program, that would find 3 points, which are closest to the given *x0* and *y0* coordinates. The first line contains *n* and the coordinates *x0* and *y0*, the other lines contain an *n* number of x and y coordinate pairs.

*Example:*
| in.txt | out.txt | 
| ------ | ------- |
| 10 7 2<br>5 6 -2 6 1 2 10 15 9 3<br>5 3 7 7 -1 -1 6 -2 2 2 | (9; 3)<br>(5; 3)<br>(6; 2) |

## Task 6:
A marksman shot at a target *n* times (*n* < 200). Having hit the target, he is given 0-9 points. The text file has 2 lines, the first has *n*, the other *n* lines have numbers 0-9. Create a program that would calculate, which point evaluation the marksman received the most.

## Task 7:
Literally a repeat of [Array (pt. 2)'s](https://github.com/SleepiCaffeine/CPP-for-school/tree/main/Arrays%20(pt.2)) task 7...

## Task 8: 
A text file can contain the birth dates of up to 3 million people. The birth dates are written YYYY/MM/DD. Create a program, which would calculate the most frequent birth month.
