## Intro
This is a repo for all of my C++ projects that pertain to school related tasks/projects[^1]📚🎓
[^1]: If I remember, I'll add a translation about what tasks I'm doing and I'm trying to do ༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ


I'm making this all using C++11[^2]. So that's why I might use different, more convoluted solutions, although I am still a beginner, so any and all advice is appreciated 💜

[^2]: Exams require us to use C++11, I am a junior and I am terrified ._.

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome, forks even more so! If you have any major suggestions, you could first open an issue and I would see what I can do.
